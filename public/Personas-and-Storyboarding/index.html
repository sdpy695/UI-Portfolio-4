            <h6 >The Interface</h6>
            <p class="intro">The self checkout machine allows more customers to pay at once without requiring more staff. The interface is an evolution of the cashier-manned checkout, with the scanning system and payment system both oriented to face the customer.</p>
          
            <p class="intro">This exercise explores the personas of the users who interact with a specific interface. I observed real users interacting with a the self checkout machine at a local grocery store and interviewed the individuals about their experiences.</p>

              <p>Watching users interact with the machine, I made 3 key observations: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> People are distracted approaching checkout, often on the phone, in conversation with a partner or child, with headphones in. </li>
                <li> Everyone observed approaches the machine with confidence. </li>
                <li> When users are confused, some struggle through the process themselves, some are quick to flag down the attendant and ask for help. </li>

                <li>What was frustrating about using the self checkout?</li>
                <li>Was there anything missing that you expected?</li>

          <h6>User Findings</h6>
          <p>Generally, surveyed users reported felt satisfied with their experience and confident in their ability to navigate the interface. Several said they could see how it would be confusing if they had never seen the machine before, but could navigate the interface easily due to familiarity. The greatest frustrations were concerned with the feature that allows users to look up individual items which will not scan with a barcode, and with the way the interface is occasionally triggered to freeze until an attendant can allow the user to resume checkout.</p>

        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        <p>Though using the self checkout can be a complicated process with many steps, shoppers who elect to use the self checkout easily navigate the interface through a combination of familiarity and signage. The greatest inconvenience of the system is the stilted integration between the machine and the attendant.</p>
