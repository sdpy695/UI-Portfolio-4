        	<p class="intro">
            This project addresses <a href="https://unitedstates.diplomatie.belgium.be/en">the website</a> for the Belgian Embassy and Consulates in the United States. The current website is disorganized and difficult to view on a mobile device.

           <img style="width: 105%" src="assets/annotated-mobile.jpg"/>

         <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>There are several fundamental issues with this site which make it inaccessible to the target users:</p>
                <li>The page is full of small text with low contrast against its background</li>
                <li>The images included don't have alt text, so they can't be interpreted by a screenreader</li>
                <li>On the mobile version of the site, the buttons are too small for even the most dextrous fingers to reach them on a touchscreen.</li>
                <li>The language bar gets lost in the corner, allowing for users to be trapped in a version of the site that's in a language they don't understand. In combination with the small buttons, users with less mobility aren't able to access the language change feature.</li>
