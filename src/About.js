            My name is Chloe and I am a junior user interface designer based in Providence, RI. I have a passion for creating intuitive and appealing designs that enhance the user experience. My design style is influenced by accessibility, functionality, and a strong focus on user-centered design principles.

            <p>
            I'm currently in my third year of Computer Science at Brown University. I've gained valuable experience through internships at <a href="https://www.sasaki.com/">Sasaki</a> and the <a href="https://www.sustaininfrastructure.org/">Center for Sustainable Infrastructure</a>, and a term at the <a href="https://berlinartinstitute.com/">Berlin Art Institute</a>. I have a strong foundation in design principles and am proficient in design software such as Adobe Creative Suite and Figma.

            In my spare time, you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, drawing, and tinkering with code. I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and improve as a designer, and I am excited to see where my career takes me next.
