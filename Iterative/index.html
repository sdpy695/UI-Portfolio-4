          <h6>NFTScoring</h6>
          <p>NFTScoring is an NFT trading platform with the goal of giving NFT investors all the information needed in order to make smart decisions when buying or selling NFTs. Anyone can use a free account, but there is also a premium version for users to gain more access. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In this group project, we used an iterative user-testing process to design a mobile app for the platform, incorporating feedback into our final product. We expect our app to serve users within a range between beginners and moderately knowledgable about NFTs. The aim was to create a product that is easy to navigate for users who are new to NFT trading. 
          </p>

          <h6>Sketching</h6>
          <p>We came up with four different possible designs for the app. Each design imagines a different user flow through a unique organization of components for the app.  </p>
          
          <div style=" justify-content:center; display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap:wrap; align-items:center">
            <div class="project-image" style="padding-top: 6%; width: 40%"> <img  src="assets/sketch2.png"> </div>
              <div class="project-image" style="padding-top: 6%; width: 40%"> <img  src="assets/sketch3.png"> </div>
                <div class="project-image" style="padding-top: 6%; width: 40%" > <img  src="assets/sketch1.png"></div>
            <!-- <img style="padding-top: 6%; width: 40%"  src="assets/sketch1a.png">
            <img style="padding-top: 0%; width: 40%"src="assets/sketch1b.png">
            <img style="padding-top: 0%; width: 40%" src="assets/sketch1c.png"> -->
            <div class="project-image" style="padding-top: 0%; width: 40%"> <img  src="assets/sketch4.jpg"></div>
          </div>

          <div style="padding-top: 10%"> 
          <h6>Wireframing</h6>

          <p>Combining the best features of each sketch, we developed one coherent layout for the app's pages. The main flow of the app includes a "Home" page with a newsfeed, a "Wallet" page showing the user's current assets, a "Discover" page to serach for specific NFT's, and a "Learn" page with information about NFT trading and the app itself.</p>
          <div style="padding-top: 10%; width: 90%; flex-wrap: wrap; display: flex">
            <div class="project-image"> <img style= "width: 32%" src="assets/low-fi/Discover.png"></div>
            <div class="project-image"> <img style= "width: 32%"src="assets/low-fi/Home.png"></div>
            <div class="project-image"> <img style= "width: 32%" src="assets/low-fi/Learning.png"></div>
            <div class="project-image"> <img style= "width: 32%" src="assets/low-fi/NFT.png"></div>
            <div class="project-image"> <img style= "width: 32%" src="assets/low-fi/Profile.png"></div>
            <div class="project-image"> <img style= "width: 32%"src="assets/low-fi/Wallet lofi.png"></div>
            
          </div> 

          <h6>Hi-Fi</h6>
          <p>We then fleshed out the wireframes into a hi-fi interactive prototype.</p>
          <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2Fxqozh43vH31DjqnaspPwkY%2FNFTScoring-Draft-1%3Fpage-id%3D0%253A1%26node-id%3D30%253A1373%26viewport%3D1007%252C-240%252C0.31%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D30%253A1373%26show-proto-sidebar%3D1" allowfullscreen></iframe>



          <h6>Critique</h6>

          <p>We asked a group of peers to review our mockup and provide feedback on the interface. The feedback we received can be summarized by the following categories: 
            <li><b>Popups: </b>the look of our popups didn't quite align with users' mental model for popups: ours were unexpecedly scrollable and hard to exit out of.</li>
            <li><b>Font Size: </b>the fonts across some of our pages were inconsistent and occasionally to small to read, even on mobile. </li>
            <li><b>Top Bar: </b>users found it strange that the top bar disappeared when scrolling, while the home bar on the bottom was sticky. The original top bar also had mild inconsistencies accross pages and occasionally got cut off by the notch in the top of the iPhone screen</li>
          To address these issues, we drafted a second version of the hi-fi prototype:
            </p>

          <h6>User Testing</h6>

          <p>We conducted a remote usibility test using the service <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/"> User Testing</a>. Users received the following instructions before interacting with the protoype:</p>
              <div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right: 5%;">
                <p > 
                  "Imagine you are using a user of NFTScoring who wants to explore new NFTs that you may not have seen before. Navigate through the app until you find a popup for a trending NFT. 
                  
                  Please think out loud with any thoughts that come to your head as you navigate through our site to help us understand your thinking!"
